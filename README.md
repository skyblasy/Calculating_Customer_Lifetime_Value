# Calculating Customer Lifetime Value
### Why is Understanding Customer Lifetime Value Important?

In the competitive landscape of modern business, understanding the value each customer brings to a company is not just a strategic advantageâ€”it's an imperative. One of the most significant metrics in this respect is the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV). Delving deep into CLV provides businesses with a lens through which they can view and forecast their interactions with customers, from initial acquisition to eventual parting ways.

At its core, CLV represents the total revenue a business can expect from a single customer account throughout the duration of their relationship. It's an indicator of not just how much a customer is worth now, but how much they'll be worth in the future. This foresight is invaluable. By comprehending the potential long-term value of a customer, businesses can make informed decisions about how much they're willing to spend on acquiring new customers and the extent to which they should go to retain existing ones. In a world where acquisition costs often surpass retention expenses, this knowledge can significantly impact a company's bottom line.
